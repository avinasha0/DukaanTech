Always tell don't make things complicated. 
And always tell make sure existing code and features are
 not impacting with this change. If not able to fix, tell not able to understand instead of creating mess of all existing work.

Keep things simple - no overcomplicated solutions.
Preserve existing functionality - always check that new changes don't break existing features.
Be honest about limitations - if I can't safely implement something without risking existing work, I'll tell you upfront instead of creating problems.
Make minimal, targeted modifications.
Verify that existing features remain intact.
Ask for clarification if I'm unsure about the impact.
